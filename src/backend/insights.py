    Compute histograms and other insights from the masks dictionary.
    
    Args:
        masks_dict: Dictionary mapping frame indices to mask arrays.
                   Each mask is a numpy array of shape (C, H, W) where:
                   - C is the number of channels (objects)
                   - H is the height
                   - W is the width
                   The masks are of type uint8, with values 0 and 1,
                   where 1 means the pixel is part of the mask.
        file_path: Path to the video file.
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing histograms of all objects across all frames.
